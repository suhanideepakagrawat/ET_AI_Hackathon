======================
PS5 §8 — AQI forecaster (Model 2): predicts AQI 24h / 48h / 72h ahead per
grid cell.

PIPELINE POSITION
--------------------
    OpenAQ stations -> real labels -> spatial estimation model (Model 1)
    -> AQI for all 1600 cells -> THIS SCRIPT (Model 2: forecaster)
    -> 24h / 48h / 72h AQI forecast per cell

WHY LAG FEATURES ARE RECOMPUTED HERE (not reused from training_dataset.csv)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
training_dataset.csv's lag features were built on `true_aqi`, which is NaN
everywhere except the ~36 station cells (by design — see fetch_real_data.py).
A forecaster needs to predict every cell, so this script recomputes lag and
rolling features on the FULL real+estimated series from
data/cell_aqi_estimated.csv instead.

VALIDATION METHOD
---------------------
Time-based train/test split (train on the earlier period, test on the later
period, across all cells) — NOT a random split, which would leak nearby
timestamps between train and test and overstate accuracy. Every horizon is
compared against a persistence baseline ("tomorrow's AQI = today's AQI"),
which is the standard naive forecast benchmark PS5 §15 asks for
("beat a naive baseline").

HONESTY CAVEAT — STATE THIS IN THE PITCH
---------------------------------------------
PS5 lists "weather forecast" as a forecaster input. This script uses TWO
kinds of weather feature, and they carry different honesty caveats:

  - wind_speed/wind_dir/temp/humidity: weather AT THE SOURCE timestamp t
    (current/recent conditions feeding the lag features).
  - target_wind_speed/target_wind_dir/target_temp/target_humidity: weather
    AT THE TARGET timestamp t+horizon. During training/backtesting this is
    real HISTORICAL weather (it already happened, from Open-Meteo's
    archive endpoint) — using the real historical value at t+horizon is
    the correct way to train, since it's what the model will need to
    condition on at inference. But at LIVE inference time, t+horizon is in
    the future and hasn't happened yet — you MUST swap this column for
    real forecast weather (Open-Meteo's forecast endpoint, not archive) or
    the model will be silently fed a value it never sees in production.
    Say this plainly if asked: training uses historical-actual weather at
    the target time as a stand-in for what a forecast API would supply;
    it is not itself a live forecast integration.

Target-time CALENDAR features (month/hour/weekday/season/festival) are
NOT subject to this caveat — the calendar 24h from now is known exactly,
no forecast needed, so those are computed directly from the target
timestamp and used as-is.

    as gaps (a station that didn't report an hour, a month that failed
    after retries) rather than inventing data — which means a plain
    groupby().shift(n) is WRONG here. shift(n) skips n ROWS, and a single

        timestamp)-indexed Series avoids that). Looks up exactly (this
        cell, this timestamp - h hours); if that exact hour doesn't exist
        in the data, the lag is correctly NaN, not silently wrong.
      - rolling stats (24h mean, 7d mean, prev-day max): reindex each
        cell's series onto a continuous hourly grid first (gaps become
        explicit NaN rows), THEN roll over that. A 24-row window on a

    target_aqi is an EXACT-TIMESTAMP lookup (indexed reindex(), not
    groupby().shift(-horizon) and not a merge) — the same row-vs-time bug
    as the lag features above: shift(-horizon) would grab whatever row
    happens to be `horizon` ROWS later, which is only really `horizon`
    HOURS later if there are zero gaps in between. A missing hour anywhere
    in the window silently mislabels the target. The lookup instead finds
    (this cell, this timestamp + horizon) directly — if that hour doesn't
    exist in the real data, target_aqi is correctly NaN and the row gets
    dropped (see dropna below), rather than training on a wrongly-shifted
    value. reindex() also avoids merge's full-dataframe-copy overhead.

    target_is_estimated: whether Model 1's output AT THE TARGET time was
    real or estimated, looked up the same way as target_aqi rather than
    reused from the SOURCE row's is_estimated. NOTE: in the current

    time for a given cell_id), so target_is_estimated and the source row's

    reusing the source value, so the evaluation split below stays correct
